- Navigating with `h (left)`, `j (down)`, `k (up)`, and `l (right)`.
- Deleting a character with `x`.
- Undo with `u` and redo with `Ctrl + r`.

    - To copy a single line, press `yy` (yank yank) while in Normal Mode.
    - To copy multiple lines, type `#yy` where `#` is the number of lines you want to copy. For example, `3yy` copies 3 lines.
    - To paste the copied text, press `p` to paste below the cursor or `P` to paste above the cursor.
2. **Cut (Delete) and Paste**:
    - To cut a single line, press `dd` (delete delete) while in Normal Mode.
    - To cut multiple lines, type `#dd` where `#` is the number of lines you want to cut. For example, `3dd` cuts 3 lines.
