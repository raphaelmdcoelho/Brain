The `/etc/windows_credentails` file is used when mounting a CIFS (Common Internet File System) or SMB (Server Message Block) network share on Linux systems, particularly when accessing shares from a Windows server.

## Purpose

1. Storing credentials securely: This file stores the necessary authentication details - username, password, and domain - required to access a Windows shared folder. It provides a way to supply these credentials without embedding them directly in the mount command or configuration files.
2. Mounting Windows Shares: When you mount a Windows network share on Linux using the CIFS protocol, you often need to provide a username, password, and sometimes a domain name. The `etc/windows_credentails` file allows you to specify these credentials in a separate, secured file, instead of directly exposing sensitive information in you `fstab` file or mount commands.

## Typical file structure

```bash
username=your_username
password=your_password
domain=your_domain
```
