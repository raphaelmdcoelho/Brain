The `/etc/windows_credentails` file is used when mounting a CIFS (Common Internet File System) or SMB (Server Message Block) network share on Linux systems, particularly when accessing shares from a Windows server.

## Purpose

1. Storing credentials securely: This file stores the necessary authentication details - username, password, and domain - required to access a Windows shared folder. It provides a way to supply these credentials without embedding them directly in the mount command or configuration files.
2. Mounting Windows Shares: When you mount a Windows network share on Linux using the CIFS protocol, you often need to provide a username, password, and sometimes a domain name. The `etc/windows_credentails` file allows you to specify these credentials in a separate, secured file, instead of directly exposing sensitive information in you `fstab` file or mount commands.

## Typical file structure

```bash
username=your_username
password=your_password
domain=your_domain
```

## How It Works

When you specify the credentials file in a mount command (e.g., `mount -t cifs //server/share/mnt/point -o credentails=/etc/windows_credentials`), the CIFS driver reads the credentials from this file. So using this file, the mount command does not require you to specify credentials directly in the command line, helping automation process.

The file should have restricted permissions (`0600`) so only root user can read it: 

```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/windows_credentials
sudo chmod 600 /etc/windows_credentials
```
