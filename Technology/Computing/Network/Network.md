### Concepts

**Evolution**

1. Cup phone => two cups, one string and the frequency and amplitude that are transferred from one cup to another through the string. 
2. Telephone / telephone operator => Telephone call to a operator that connects "your cable" to the "other person cable", similar like the example above.
3. Telephone / Switches => The operator was replace by a machine called `switch` that change the connections automatically. (circuit switching / comutação de cirtuito).
	**Note**: in that case, the `lines` (cables) become unavailable during the whole call.
4. Actual => Now we are not using the `circuit switching` anymore, we are using the `package switching`. There are no more equipments using a connection to the addressee in `stateful` way, everybody are connected together, so `stateless`. (the users are not blocking the channels anymore).

### Units

`8 bits = 1 byte`
`1 Kilobytes (KB) = 1024 bytes`
`1 Megabytes (MB) = 1024 KB`
`1 Gibabytes (GB) = 1024 MB`

<hr>

Network scale to measure speed: 

`bits` so -> 200 Mbps / 8 = 25 Megabytes por segundo.
