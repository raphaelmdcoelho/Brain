### Concepts

In this context, is like combine multiple voice talks in the same cable.

<hr>

**Human voice frequency scale**: 0 - 4 khz.

So, as the human voice takes a small scale into all possibilities from a cable, a technology called `ADSL` was created to make the voice call free to calling and the other ones available to the internet.

**ADSL CAP**

0 - 4 Khz - voice
25 - 160 Khz - upstream
240 Khz - Max - downstream

<hr>

Then, `DMT` (Discrete Multi Tone) was a evolution of `ADSL` that divided the channel into 247 channels with 4 Khz.
