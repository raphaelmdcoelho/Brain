### Concepts

In computing, a daemon is a background process that runs continuously and performs specific operations at predefined times or in response to certain events. It's a type of program on Unix and Unix-like systems.

### Characteristics of Daemons

- **Background Operation**: Daemons typically operate in the background, not directly interacting with the user interface.
- **Longevity**: They are usually long-running processes, starting when the system boots up and running until it shuts down.
- **Specific Tasks**: Each daemon is designed to handle specific tasks. For example, a print spooler daemon manages print jobs.

### Differences between daemons and agents

- **Scope**: [[Agent]], especially in contexts like Azure, might have a broader scope, including interacting with various services and resources over a network. Daemons usually have a more focused role on a single system.
- **Interactivity**: Some agents are designed to interact more directly with users or systems, whereas daemons tend to be more isolated to their specific function.
