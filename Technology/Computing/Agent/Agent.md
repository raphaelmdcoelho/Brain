### Concepts

In computing, an agent is a piece of software that acts on behalf of a user or other program. It's autonomous, meaning it can perform tasks without direct intervention, and is often designed to be proactive and reactive in different situations.

### Example

**Azure Agents**: In the context of Azure, agents are often used for various tasks like automating deployment, monitoring, managing resources, and more. These agents can reside either on Azure (as part of a service) or on-premises, where they interact with Azure services.
    
**Application Deployment**: Azure agents are crucial in the deployment of applications. They can automate the process, ensure consistent deployment across environments, and handle tasks like fetching code from repositories, executing build and test scripts, and deploying code to production.
    
**Types of Agents**: You might encounter different types of agents in Azure, like Azure Pipelines agents, which are used for continuous integration and deployment. There are also monitoring agents, used for tracking the performance and health of applications and services.
