Another common problem that you may face is the encoding of the byte data. An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character. The two most common encodings are the ==ASCII== and ==UNICODE== formats. ASCII can only store 128 characters, while Unicode can contain up to 1,114,113 characters. (ASCII is actually a subset of Unicode (UTF-8), so ASCII and Unicode share the same numerical to character values.)
