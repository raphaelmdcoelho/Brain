### Concepts

At their core, notebook applications are interactive computing environments. They allow users to weave together code, text, and multimedia into a single, coherent document. Unlike traditional scripts or applications, where code is written and then executed separately, notebooks let users tun code in "cells" and immediately view the results. This real-time feedback is invaluable for data analysis, visualization, and iterative development.

### Core Features & Benefits

1. **Interactivity**: Run code and see results immediately.
2. **Documentation**: Combine markdown text, code, and outputs in a single document.
3. **Visualization**: Easily display charts, graphs, and images.
4. **Shareability**: Share your work with others, making it easier for collaboration and replication.
5. **Extensions & Plugins**: Many notebook applications, especially Jupyter, have a vast ecosystem of plugins that enhance functionality.
