### Concept

`RxJS` is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observables sequences. It provides one core type, the `Observable`, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.

ReactiveX combines the `Observer pattern` with the `Iterator pattern` and `functional programming with collections` to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

* **Observable**: represents the idea of an ==invokable collection== of ==future values or events==.
* **Observer**: is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
