The `overflow-y` CSS property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's top bottom edges. It's particularly useful for controlling the display of content in a confined area, like a dropdown list.

* ***`auto` Value***: Setting `overflow-y: auto` tells the browser to provide a scrollbar if the content exceeds the height of the element.
* ***Other Values**: Other common values for `overflow-y` include `visible` (overflow is not clipped and may be rendered outside the element's box), `hidden` (content is clipped and no scrollbars are provided), and `scroll` (scrollbars are provided regardless of whether they are necessary).
