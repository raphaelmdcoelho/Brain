You can obtain the dotnet tool either by installing the .NET 6 SDK or by installing Visual Studio. Its default location is %ProgramFiles%\dotnet on Windows or /usr/bin/dotnet on Ubuntu Linux.

To compile an application, the dotnet tool requires a project file as well as one or more C# files. The following command scaffolds a new console project:

```cshap
dotnet new Console -n MyFirstProgram
```

To build and run your program, run the following command from the MyFirstProgram folder:

```csharp
dotnet run MyFirstProgram
```

Or, if you just want to build without running:

```csharp
dotnet build MyFristPRogram.csproj
```

The output assembly will be written to a subdirectory under `bin\debug`.

#dotnet
