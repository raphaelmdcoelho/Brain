It involves assigning users to roles and granting permissions to those roles. In ASP.NET Core, role-based authorization can be implemented using the built-in role-based authentication system or by integrating with an external identity provider, such as Active Directory or Azure AD.

To use role-based authorization, you need to assign roles to users and configure the appropriate authentication scheme to retrieve the user’s roles during authentication. This can be done using the `AddRoles` and `AddRoleManager` methods in your application's startup class.

Once roles are assigned to users, you can use the `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` attribute or the `User.IsInRole("Admin")` method to check whether a user has a specific role. This allows you to restrict access to specific resources or actions based on the user's role.
