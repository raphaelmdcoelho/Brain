It is used for asynchronous iteration. It allows you to iterate over a sequence of values asynchronously, which is particularly useful when dealing with IO-bound or long-running operations that yield multiple values over time. Unlike `IEnumerable`, which is synchronous and blocks the thread while iterating over a sequence, `IAsyncEnumerable` permits the rest of your application to continue executing while waiting for the next element in the sequence.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        await foreach (var number in GetNumbersAsync())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number);
        }
    }

    static async IAsyncEnumerable<int> GetNumbersAsync()
    {
        int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        foreach (int number in numbers)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
            yield return number;
        }
    }
}

```
