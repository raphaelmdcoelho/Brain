### Dynamic binding

The process of resolving types and members from compile time to runtime and is useful in scenarios that would otherwise require complicated reflection code. Since the compiler will not do type checking at compile time, it's possible to work with anonymous types in a method.

### Optional parameters

Allow functions to specify default parameter values so that callers can omit arguments, and `named arguments` allow a function caller to identify an argument by name rather than position.

### Type variance

Type variance rules were relaxed in C# 4.0 such that type parameters in generic interfaces and generic delegates can be marked as [[Covariance and Contravariance]], allowing more natural type conversions.
