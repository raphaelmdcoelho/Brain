### Async and Await

C# 5.0's big new feature was support for `asynchronous functions` via two new keywords, [[async - await]]. Asynchronous functions enable `asynchronous continuations`, which make it easier to write responsive and thread-safe rich-client applications. They also make it easy to writehighly concurrent and efficient I/O-bound applications that don't tie up a thread resource per operation.
