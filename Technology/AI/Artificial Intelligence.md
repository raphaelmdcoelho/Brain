## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

It's a branch of computer science that make possible the creation of systems that can perform task that would normally require human itelligence.

### What are the different types of artificial intelligence?

* **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: this is the most common form of AI we interact with today. It's designed to perform a single task.
* **Artificial General Intelligence**: An AI with AGI possesses the ability to understand, learn, adapt, and implement knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level.
* **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)**: The final level of AI, ASI, refers to a future scenario where AI surpasses human intelligence in nearly all economically valuable work. This concept, while intriguing, remains largely speculative.

### The difference between data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning & deep learning

* **Artificial Intelligence** refers to computer systems that can behave intelligently, reason, and learn like humans.
* **Machine learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms with the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.
* **Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning. It is responsible for many of the awe-inspiring news stories  about AI in the news. Deep learning algorithms are inspired by the bran's structure and work exceptionally well with unstructured data such as images, videos, or text.
* **Data science** is a cross-disciplinary field that uses all of the above, amongst other skills like data analysis, statistics, data visualization, and more, to get insight from data.
