We use Stemming to normalize words. In English and many other languages, a single word can take multiple forms depending upon context used. For instance, the verb “study” can take many forms like “studies,” “studying,” “studied,” and others, depending on its context. When we tokenize words, an interpreter considers these input words as different words even though their underlying meaning is the same. Moreover, as we know that NLP is about analyzing the meaning of content, to resolve this problem, we use stemming.

Stemming normalizes the word by truncating the word to its stem word. For example, the words “studies,” “studied,” “studying” will be reduced to **“studi,”** making all these word forms to refer to only one token. Notice that stemming may not give us a dictionary, grammatical word for a particular set of words.
