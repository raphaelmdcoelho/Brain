The goal of ==NLP== (Natural Language Processing) is to make computers understand unstructured text and retrieve meaningful pieces of information from it.

### Rule-based NLP vs. Statistical NLP

Natural Language Processing is separated in two different approaches:

**Rule-based Natural Language Processing:**

It uses common sense reasoning for processing tasks. For instance, the freezing temperature can lead to death, or hot coffee can burn people’s skin, along with other common sense reasoning tasks. However, this process can take much time, and it requires manual effort.

**Statistical Natural Language Processing:**

It uses large amounts of data and tries to derive conclusions from it. Statistical NLP uses machine learning algorithms to train NLP models. After successful training on large amounts of data, the trained model will have positive outcomes with deduction.

### Components of Natural Language Processing (NLP):

**a. Lexical Analysis:** (==Structure: words, paragraphs, sentences...==)

With lexical analysis, we divide a whole chunk of text into paragraphs, sentences, and words. It involves identifying and analyzing words’ structure.

**b. Syntactic Analysis:** (==Words in a sentence: grammar, relationship)

Syntactic analysis involves the analysis of words in a sentence for grammar and arranging words in a manner that shows the relationship among the words. For instance, the sentence “The shop goes to the house” does not pass.

**c. Semantic Analysis:** (==Exaction meaning of words and text meaningfulness==)

Semantic analysis draws the exact meaning for the words, and it analyzes the text meaningfulness. Sentences such as “hot ice-cream” do not pass.

**d. Disclosure Integration:** (==Context of the text_)

Disclosure integration takes into account the context of the text. It considers the meaning of the sentence before it ends. For example: “He works at Google.” In this sentence, “he” must be referenced in the sentence before it.

**e. Pragmatic Analysis:**

Pragmatic analysis deals with overall communication and interpretation of language. It deals with deriving meaningful use of language in various situations.

# NLP libraries:

**[[NLTK]] (Natural Language Toolkit)(https://www.nltk.org/).**
	The NLTK Python framework is generally used as an education and research tool. It’s not usually used on production applications. However, it can be used to build exciting programs due to its ease of use.

**spaCy(https://spacy.io/).**
	spaCy is an open-source natural language processing Python library designed to be fast and production-ready. spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage.

**Gensim(https://pypi.org/project/gensim/).**
	Gensim is an NLP Python framework generally used in topic modeling and similarity detection. It is not a general-purpose NLP library, but it handles tasks assigned to it very well.
 
**Pattern(https://github.com/clips/pattern).**
	Pattern is an NLP Python framework with straightforward syntax. It’s a powerful tool for scientific and non-scientific tasks. It is highly valuable to students.

**TextBlob(https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/).**
	TextBlob is a Python library designed for processing textual data.
