## Concepts

It is used on a Unix or LInux system to execute the arguments as a shell command. It is useful when trying to run a command that was stored in a variable.

eval's capability to handle command replacement is yet another potent feature. Linux eval evaluates the output of the command and treats it as a component of the bigger command when a command is enclosed in backticks or the $(...) syntax. Based on the outcomes of other commands, this functionality enables the dynamic formulation and execution of commands.
## Usage

```bash
eval [arguments]
```
